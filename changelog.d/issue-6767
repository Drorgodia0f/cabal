synopsis:  Remove World file functionality
packages: cabal-install
issues: #6767
prs: #7746
description: {
In v1-install, 'world' was used to trace what packages have been
installed, and re-install everything that is listed in it on-demand. However, in
v2-install, this is no longer needed, and outdated.
Additionally, 'world' code-path is probably not up-to-date, remove it instead of
having partial features.

- Don't generate `world` file in `~/.cabal` when `v1-install` is executed.

- Don't ever read `world` from `~/.cabal`.

- Remove meta-target `world` from `v1-install`.
}
