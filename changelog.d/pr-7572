synopsis: Make cabal respect setgid permission bit when creating directories
packages: cabal-install Cabal
prs: #7572
issues: #7560

description: {

- Previously cabal would override an admin's choice to use setgid on the
  .cabal directory by using hardcoded file and directory modes upon
  creation. Instead we now take what the system decides and only add to
  that set of permissions.
