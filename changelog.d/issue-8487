synopsis: "Build profile" message now reflects optimization level set in global config
packages: cabal-install
prs: #8488
issues: #8487

description: {

Imagine you have `optimization: 2` in your `~/.cabal/config`, and you call `cabal build`
in a project that doesn't have optimization level explicitly set in its project file.
You will still see 'Build profile: -w ghc-<VER> -O1'. This is incorrect and was fixed
in this patch: now you'll see '-O2'.
