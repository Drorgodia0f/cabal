synopsis: default configuration no longer written when config file is given explicitly
packages: cabal-install
issues: #7705
prs: #7715
description: {

- When no config file exists, `cabal` commands will create a default one.

- This behavior is discontinued now when the config file is given explicitly
  via the `--config-file` option or the `CABAL_CONFIG` environment variable.

- If no config file is given explicitly, and the default config file
  (relative to `CABAL_DIR`) does not exist, it is created as it used to be.
