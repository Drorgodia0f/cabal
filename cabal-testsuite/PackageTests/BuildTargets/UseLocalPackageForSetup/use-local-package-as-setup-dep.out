cabal: Could not resolve dependencies:
trying: pkg-1.0 (user goal)
next goal: setup-dep (user goal)
rejecting: setup-dep-2.0 (conflict: pkg => setup-dep==1.*)
rejecting: setup-dep-1.0 (constraint from user target requires ==2.0)
fail (backjumping, conflict set: pkg, setup-dep)
After searching the rest of the dependency tree exhaustively, these were the goals I've had most trouble fulfilling: setup-dep (3), pkg (2)
# cabal new-build
Resolving dependencies...
In order, the following would be built:
 - setup-dep-1.0 (lib:setup-dep) (requires download & build)
 - setup-dep-2.0 (first run)
 - pkg-1.0 (lib:pkg) (first run)
